ðŸ‘‰ How would you ensure the following?
High availability of the queue even if some nodes fail
Ordering guarantees of messages
At-least-once delivery of messages


1. High availability:
Yes, run queue brokers on multiple nodes managed by Kubernetes (good point âœ…).
Replicate messages across nodes (e.g., each partition has multiple replicas).
Use a leader-follower model â†’ one replica is the leader, followers replicate logs. 
If the leader fails, followers can take over (via leader election).
This ensures the queue survives node failures.

2. Ordering guarantees:
Divide the queue into partitions. Within each partition, messages are strictly ordered (append-only log).
A consumer reads from a partition sequentially, ensuring order is preserved.
Across partitions, global ordering is not guaranteed â€” but thatâ€™s usually acceptable in distributed queues.

3. At-least-once delivery:
Consumers acknowledge messages after processing.
If a consumer crashes before sending an ACK, the broker will redeliver the message to another consumer.
This may cause duplicates, but idempotent processing on the consumer side can handle it.

"For high availability, Iâ€™d replicate messages across nodes with leader-follower replication, 
managed by Kubernetes for failover. For ordering, Iâ€™d enforce per-partition ordering using an append-only log. 
For at-least-once delivery, Iâ€™d use acknowledgments and redelivery on failure, with idempotent consumers to handle duplicates."
