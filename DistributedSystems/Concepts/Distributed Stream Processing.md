Distributed Stream Processing

Distributed stream processing systems handle continuous flows of data in real-time across multiple nodes.

Key Features:
- Process data streams as they arrive (low latency).
- Scale by distributing workload across nodes.
- Fault tolerance and exactly-once or at-least-once processing guarantees.

Popular Frameworks:
- **Apache Flink:** Supports event-time processing and complex event processing.  
- **Apache Storm:** Real-time computation system with low latency.  
- **Kafka Streams:** Stream processing library built on Apache Kafka.

Use Cases:
- Real-time analytics.
- Fraud detection.
- Monitoring and alerting.
