Microservices Architecture

Microservices break an application into small, loosely coupled services that communicate over the network.

Benefits:
- Independent deployment and scaling.
- Technology heterogeneity (different services can use different tech stacks).
- Fault isolation: failure in one service does not bring down the entire system.

Challenges:
- Service discovery.
- Distributed tracing and monitoring.
- Data consistency and transactions across services.
- Network latency and failure handling.

Common Tools:
- **API Gateways:** Manage request routing, authentication (e.g., Kong, Ambassador).
- **Service Mesh:** Handles service-to-service communication (e.g., Istio, Linkerd).
- **Container Orchestration:** Deploy and manage microservices (e.g., Kubernetes).
