Distributed Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring and logging are crucial for managing distributed systems.

Key Aspects:
- Collecting metrics from many nodes (CPU, memory, network).
- Centralizing logs for analysis.
- Detecting failures and performance issues.

Popular Tools:
- **Prometheus:** Metrics collection and alerting.
- **Grafana:** Visualization dashboards.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** Log aggregation and analysis.
- **Jaeger / Zipkin:** Distributed tracing for latency analysis.

Challenges:
- Correlating data across nodes.
- Handling high volumes of metrics and logs.
- Ensuring minimal performance overhead.
