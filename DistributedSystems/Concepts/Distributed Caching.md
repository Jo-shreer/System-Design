Distributed Caching

Distributed caching stores frequently accessed data in multiple cache servers to reduce latency and improve throughput.

Benefits:
- Faster data access by serving from cache rather than slower databases.
- Reduced load on backend databases.
- Scalability by adding more cache nodes.

Common Architectures:
- **Client-side caching:** Cache maintained on client devices.
- **Server-side caching:** Centralized or distributed cache servers.

Popular Distributed Cache Systems:
- **Redis:** In-memory data store with replication and persistence.
- **Memcached:** Simple, high-performance caching system.
- **Hazelcast:** In-memory data grid with distributed caching.

Challenges:
- Cache consistency with the underlying data store.
- Handling cache invalidation and updates.
- Balancing cache size and eviction policies.
