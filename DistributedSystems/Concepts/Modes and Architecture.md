Distributed System Models & Architectures

Architectural Models
- Client-Server: Clients request; servers respond.
- Peer-to-Peer: Equal nodes sharing resources.
- Three-Tier: Presentation, Application, Data layers.
- Distributed Shared Memory: Virtual shared memory across nodes.

System Models
- Synchronous: Known bounds on delays and processing.
- Asynchronous: No timing guarantees.
- Partially Synchronous: Behaves asynchronously but eventually synchronous.

Communication Models
- Message Passing: Nodes send/receive messages (sync or async).
- Shared Memory: Nodes read/write shared variables (simulated).

Importance of Architecture
Architecture affects fault tolerance, scalability, and complexity; choosing the right model fits system needs.
