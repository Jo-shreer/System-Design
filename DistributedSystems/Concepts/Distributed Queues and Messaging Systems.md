Used to enable asynchronous communication between components in distributed applications.

Key Concepts:
- Producers send messages to queues.
- Consumers receive and process messages.
- Supports decoupling of system components.

Popular Systems:
- **Apache Kafka:** High-throughput distributed messaging system.  
  Uses partitions and replication for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **RabbitMQ:** Implements Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
- **Amazon SQS:** Managed message queuing service.

Use Cases:
- Event streaming.
- Task scheduling.
- Log aggregation.
